## About Me
I am a beginner in software development and computer engineering, documenting my growth through practical projects, experiments, and continuous learning.

## What You'll Find Here
- Small coding projects
- Scripts and exercises
- Notes on problems I solved and lessons learned

## 4-Day Roadmap
- **Day 1:** Learn basic Python or JavaScript syntax and run your first programs  
- **Day 2:** Solve small exercises (loops, conditions, functions)  
- **Day 3:** Build a mini script or simple project  
- **Day 4:** Document what you learned, clean code, update README

## Goals
- Build real-world skills in software development
- Share my learning process publicly
- Create a portfolio to demonstrate growth for future job opportunities
